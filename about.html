        Founded in 2014 my website is
        designed for a diverse group of men and
        women dedicated to the creative process
        of sewing historical and contemporary
        American quilts that are inspired by various ethnicities.
        My long-term mission si to illustrate social images and
        and events via the art of quilt making throughout the 21st century.
